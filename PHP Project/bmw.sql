But&amp;nbsp;it&rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar lines of description were glibly repeated at the press launch of the &lsquo;G20&rsquo; 3 Series a week or so ago, so prominently and so often that you almost questioned your instinct to query&amp;nbsp;them. So when did the BMW 3 Series become &lsquo;mid-size&rsquo;? Hasn&rsquo;t it spent most of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/bmw-3-series-story&quot;&gt;famous 40-year history&lt;/a&gt; being the world&rsquo;s defining compact executive saloon? Wasn\'t the original version small enough that Munich didn\'t even consider it worthy of back doors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, whatever. Apparently, by BMW&rsquo;s own say so, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;mid-size&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not clear when the shift happened exactly, although I&rsquo;ve got a reasonable idea why. But&amp;nbsp;what might it mean now, you may very well wonder, for the character of a car so many of us Brits have come to know better than that of almost any other German car in the world? That\'s what we\'re here to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest &lsquo;G20&rsquo; 3 Series is the first to tip-toe over the 4.7-metre mark on overall length &ndash; and, within its own particular executive saloon niche, only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a4&quot;&gt;current Audi A4&lt;/a&gt; is longer. The three-inch growth spurt that the 3 Series has been through&amp;nbsp;is actually the second significant one in as many big redesigns. The car now sits between BMW&rsquo;s second- and third-generation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/5-series&quot;&gt;5 Series&lt;/a&gt; on overall length. Interestingly, though,&amp;nbsp;it has put on more at-the-kerb centimetres over the past two major model overhauls than it did cummulatively over its first five full model generations. So if you\'re&amp;nbsp;inclined just to shrug and say &quot;ah well; modern cars are just bigger, aren\'t they?&quot;, consider that this one has grown more in the past seven years of its history than it did in the preceeding 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s partly the existence of the 1 Series that has freed BMW&rsquo;s hand to add inches to what remains its biggest-selling model globally &ndash; but it&rsquo;s mostly one critical, commercial reality: that China has, of late, become the biggest market in the world for this car, and now approaches three times the size and importance of the car&rsquo;s next biggest single global market territory. China clearly wants the 3 Series big (let\'s not forget there\'s also a long-wheelbase version pretty much just for that market).&amp;nbsp;And China quite evidently gets what it wants, even if that means buyers elsewhere in the world, so familiar with the just-so proportions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/bmw-3-series-story&quot;&gt;&lsquo;E30&rsquo; and &lsquo;E46&rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, get a new car that looks, in profile, just a little bit as if a foot pump had been taken to its cabin. At least, it does to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might that also be why the &lsquo;G30&rsquo; has slightly more dressy, busy-looking body surfacing than the last Three, I wonder, as well as a bigger kidney grille that\'s right on the limit of appearing deliberately oversized? Does BMW&rsquo;s market research suggest China will prefer the car&amp;nbsp;like that? Now I&rsquo;m being unkind as well as pedantic, and also&amp;nbsp;generalising, I know&amp;nbsp;&ndash; but I rather suspect so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/3-bmw-3-series-320d-2018-fd-hero-rear.jpg?itok=zFSEsDQn&quot; alt=&quot;BMW 3 Series 320d Sport Line 2019 first drive review - hero rear&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/16-bmw-3-series-320d-2018-fd-static-rear.jpg?itok=6E6JV45J&quot; alt=&quot;BMW 3 Series 320d Sport Line 2019 first drive review - static rear&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/users/matt-saunders&quot;&gt;Matt Saunders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 December 2018&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-06-03 18:35:05'),

The 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/bmw&quot;&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; 3-series is the largest 3-series to date, and while some purists will complain it\'s not the pure sports sedan that it once was, it\'s still a thrill to drive with sharp handling, powerful and refined turbocharged engines, and a responsive automatic transmission. Although its exterior design is a bit conservative, the redesigned interior offers class-leading comfort, quality, and style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\'s New for 2020?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year BMW offered only the 330i, and that model is essentially unchanged for 2020. Updates include a $500 price increase, and the standard Live Cockpit Plus system now includes navigation. The Connected Package Plus is now standard, too, adding real-time traffic, BMW Remote Services including stolen-vehicle recovery, remote door unlock, and BMW Connected App and Concierge Services. The popular $2350 Premium package option has been tweaked. It now includes a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, head-up display, Live Cockpit Professional, and Connected Package Professional. Live Cockpit Professional remains a single option, but the price has been reduced to $1100. More important, BMW now offers the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26796495/2020-bmw-3-series-m340i-price/&quot;&gt;more powerful M340i model&lt;/a&gt;, which has been tuned by BMW\'s legendary high-performance M Division to deliver additional power and sharper handling. Both 3-series models are turbocharged, but the 2020 BMW M340i is powered by a six-cylinder engine, while the 330i is still powered by a four-cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing and Which One to Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;330i: $41,745&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;330i xDrive: $43,745&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;M340i: $54,995&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;M340i xDrive: $56,995&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ultimate power and performance, the M340i will satisfy; however, an all-new version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28621903/2020-bmw-m3-manual-transmission-rwd/&quot;&gt;iconic high-performance M3&lt;/a&gt; will offer even more speed and it isn\'t far from reaching the market. The 3-series that offers the best combination of luxury, performance, and value is the all-wheel-drive 330i xDrive. It\'s fun to drive, packing enough power and handling to thrill, but it also offers a smoother ride than the M340i and costs significantly less. BMW also offers that model with the M Sport package, which adds its M Sport suspension for improved handling and a few exterior enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engine, Transmission, and Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exceptional 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine powers the 2020 BMW 330i. It\'s remarkably smooth, fitted with a single turbocharger, and it makes 255 horsepower. The all-wheel-drive 330i xDrive accelerates to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, which is seriously quick, and matches the performance of its main rival, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/audi/a4&quot;&gt;Audi A4&lt;/a&gt;. For more speed, the new 2020 BMW M340i is equipped with a 382-hp turbocharged inline-six, which is incredibly refined as it revs to 7000 rpm. With rear-wheel drive, the M340i rockets from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds, which is considerably quicker than the all-wheel-drive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/audi/s4&quot;&gt;353-hp Audi S4&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a29561099/2020-bmw-3-series-vs-2020-genesis-g70/&quot;&gt;comparison test&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/genesis/g70&quot;&gt;2020 Genesis G70&lt;/a&gt;, we chose the M340i as the better sports sedan. BMW no longer offers the 3-series with a manual transmission, which is sure to irk some of the sedan\'s longtime loyalists. Instead, every 2020 BMW 3-series gets an eight-speed automatic transmission with Sport mode as well as Manual mode. With snappy shifts and smooth operation, it\'s one of the best automatics we\'ve ever experienced. Paddle shifters mounted to the steering wheel are standard. A plug-in hybrid model&ndash;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a28710134/2021-bmw-330e-drive/&quot;&gt;called 330e&lt;/a&gt;&ndash;will join the lineup for the 2021 model year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020-bmw-m340i-v-2020-genesis-g70-3p3t-989-hdr-1571838326.jpg?crop=0.867xw:0.869xh;0.133xw,0.131xh&amp;amp;resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;2020 BMW 3-Series rear&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;', 1, '2020-06-03 18:38:33'),

Back in their day, models like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a18739619/m-gmbh-reveals-mystery-v12-powered-bmw-z3-prototype/&quot;&gt;Z3&lt;/a&gt; coupe or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/bmw/i3&quot;&gt;electric i3&lt;/a&gt; provoked similarly strong emotions. And now it seems that we are entering another one of these periodic events. Starting when the first photos of the new, second-generation 4-series leaked, social media has lit up with critical commentary.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p90390203-highres-v2-1591141825.jpg?resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p90390203-highres-v2-1591141825.jpg?resize=640:* 640w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p90390203-highres-v2-1591141825.jpg?resize=768:* 768w,https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p90390203-highres-v2-1591141825.jpg?resize=980:* 980w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 BMW 4-series coupe makes a bold statement and is sure to trigger discussions among brand aficionados.

The prominent kidney reappeared after World War II, and on the 4-series, they are placed closer to their position on the 2000C/CA/CS from 1965, the mid-size coupe that later morphed into the more masculine and aggressive E9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g32732023/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-photos-info-gallery/&quot;&gt;VIEW PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-front-3-4-1591020978.jpg?crop=0.910xw:0.834xh;0.0459xw,0.0740xh&amp;amp;resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;2021 bmw 4 series coupe&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As design is a matter of taste, we\'ll say this much: The vertical kidneys don\'t look nearly as prominent as they do on some photos, which are taken from the frog perspective. The provide welcome differentiation from the 3-series, and they accentuate an altogether exceedingly clean and elegant design. Other notable features include aggressively styled LED lights, and you can even get laser lights (an option mostly for the &quot;wow&quot; effect).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The M440i gets the well-established Cerium Gray treatment on its kidneys and decor, or buyers can substitute Shadow Line Black. And every 4-series features a mesh-type pattern on the grille; BMW designers tell us that vertical slats would have made the car look too conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g32732023/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-photos-info-gallery/&quot;&gt;VIEW PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-bmw-4-series-rear-1591021054.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.918xh;0,0.0281xh&amp;amp;resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;2021 bmw 4 series coupes&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4-series features functional design: despite growing in every dimension, the drag coefficient on the not-for-the-U.S. BMW 420d is a mere 0.25. And the larger footprint translates to more space for passengers and luggage. The rear seats are comfortable even on extended trips, there is plenty of legroom, although headroom is somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front passengers sit considerably lower than in the 3-series, but they are looking at virtually the same dashboard. It\'s not a terribly modern or forward-looking design, and the center-console cover looks good but feels somewhat flimsy. Perfectionists will applaud the fact that the infotainment system now displays the animated car in menus in the actual color of the car.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g32732023/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-photos-info-gallery/&quot;&gt;VIEW PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-146-1591044048.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.918xh;0,0.0791xh&amp;amp;resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;2021 bmw 4 series coupe&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a wider track, a lower center of gravity, and an even 50/50 weight distribution, the 4-series has no problem putting its power to the ground, as we found out in late April during a coronavirus-compliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a32295356/2021-bmw-4-series-prototype-drive/&quot;&gt;prototype drive&lt;/a&gt; on Upper Bavarian country roads and a largely deserted autobahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M SPORT PACKAGE PRO PREVIEWS NEW M4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p90390689-highres-the-all-new-bmw-4-se-1591122501.jpg?crop=0.708xw:0.529xh;0.104xw,0.364xh&amp;amp;resize=300:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32744944/2021-bmw-4-series-coupe-m-sport-package-pro/&quot;&gt;BMW 4-Series Coupe M Sport Package Pro Previews M4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the U.S. market, the 4-series coupe comes in two variants: the 430i, with a turbocharged 255-hp 2.0-liter four, and the M440i, with a turbo 382-hp 3.0-liter inline-six and a 48-volt hybrid system that can provide a small boost at low rpm. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the 430i, and xDrive all-wheel drive is an option; it is obligatory on the M440i for now, although BMW says a rear-drive M440i is coming later.

(38, 26, 13, '2020 i8 Roadster M-Sport', 'bmw-i8-roadster-im-sport.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve waited a long time for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw&quot;&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; i8 Roadster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First previewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/beijing-motor-show/beijing-motor-show-2012-bmw-i8-spyder&quot;&gt;at the Beijing motor show as the i8 Concept Spyder in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, it&rsquo;s taken a full six years for the plug-in hybrid&amp;nbsp;open-top to be offered&amp;nbsp;in the UK.&amp;nbsp;In that time, the car has undergone a significant amount of development. But,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/bmw-i8-roadster-priced-%C3%82%C2%A3124735&quot;&gt;despite the long gestation&lt;/a&gt;, it hasn&rsquo;t lost any of its original impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/1-bmw-i8-roadster-2018-review-hero-front_0.jpg?itok=0MYS_REC&quot; alt=&quot;BMW i8 Roadster 2018 review hero front&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its contemporary exterior design and advanced powertrain specification might be familiar, coming some three years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i8&quot;&gt;after the launch of the&amp;nbsp;i8 Coup&eacute;&lt;/a&gt;, but there are few cars at any price that can claim to make such a powerful visual and technical statement as this roadster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, the i8&rsquo;s futuristic lines are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-i8-roadster-confirmed-2018&quot;&gt;further enhanced by the loss of its roof&lt;/a&gt;, most notably around the rear, which has gained added prominence on the roadster due to the appearance of two large buttresses in the place taken up by the liftback-style tailgate on the coup&eacute;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What else has changed beyond the removable roof?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roof, which consists of a large fabric panel and integrated header rails, opens automatically in 15 seconds at speeds up to 31mph. It boats near-silent full electric operation and stows vertically behind the two-seat cabin at the press of a button, nestling in a space-saving position between the rear bulkhead and mid-rear mounted combustion engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the new soft top, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw&quot;&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; has modified the windscreen of the i8, providing it with a strengthened carbonfibre frame. The rear window, which doubles as a wind deflector, is also altered&amp;nbsp;and can be closed or opened independently of the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further stylistic changes over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/facelifted-bmw-i8-will-get-extra-power-longer-range&quot;&gt;the facelifted i8 Coup&eacute;&amp;nbsp;that\'s set for UK delivery at the same time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in June include the deletion of the rear side windows. They are replaced by new panels overlaid with aluminium-look trims with the word \'Roadster\' on the side of the new buttresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination with further strengthening measures within the carbonfibre-reinforced plastic and aluminium structure and new frameless scissor-action doors, weight has increased by 60kg over the facelifted coup&eacute;&amp;nbsp;at 1595kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i8&quot;&gt;two-plus-two configuration of the fixed-roof i8 &lt;/a&gt;has given way to a two-seat layout, with the rear of the cabin altered to provide 92 litres of oddment space within three separate cubby holes in the rear bulkhead. It combines with the 88 litres of the rear-mounted luggage area to provide an overall 160 litres of stowage space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Explore the BMW range&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/x5-m-competition&quot;&gt;BMW X5 M Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/x6-m-competition&quot;&gt;BMW X6 M Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i3-2013-2017&quot;&gt;BMW i3 (2013-2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to top&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier dashboard design has also been lightly updated for the i8 Roadster and facelifted i8 Coup&eacute;. Among other subtle changes,&amp;nbsp;the latest version of BMW&rsquo;s iDrive system now offers&amp;nbsp;either touch control on a free-standing 8.8in monitor or via a rotary dial on the middle console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also new seats, an optional head-up display unit as well a range of new trim options, including carbonfibre trim elements for the dashboard and ceramic controls within the centre console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What mechanical changes has BMW made for the i8 Roadster?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key&amp;nbsp;change&amp;nbsp;in the powertrain&amp;nbsp;is an increase in output from the front-mounted electric motor. The unit, which was&amp;nbsp;produced in-house,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/our-cars/bmw-i8-long-term-test-review-final-report&quot;&gt;now delivers 12bhp more than it did in the earlier i8 Coup&eacute;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at 141bhp. This&amp;nbsp;is delivered along with the same 184lb ft as before, through a two-speed gearbox to the front wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with the unchanged 228bhp delivered by the turbocharged 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine mounted transversely up back in a mid-rear position, this provides the roadster&amp;nbsp;with an overall 374bhp and a theoretical maximum torque loading of 420lb ft, although the latter is continually regulated depending&amp;nbsp;on grip and traction levels, with drive delivered to the rear wheels via a six-speed torque converter-equipped automatic gearbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-i8-roadster-previewed-new-official-video&quot;&gt;Further modifications have also been made&lt;/a&gt; to the lithium-ion battery, which is mounted wholly within the centre tunnel. While similarly dimensioned to the unit used previously, its cell capacity has been raised from 20Ah to 34Ah. The use of fourth-generation cells have also increased its energy capacity from an earlier 7.1kWh to 11.6kWh. As a result, BMW quotes a pure-electric range for the i8 Roadster of 33 miles - some 10 miles more than it quoted for the earlier i8 Coup&eacute;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as recuperating energy under braking, the roadster uses the same electric motor at the rear as the i8 Coup&eacute;. It acts as a generator to top up the battery on the overrun.&amp;nbsp;Around town in eDrive Eco mode, progress is whisper quiet and quite urgent as the upgraded electric motor provides drive exclusively to the front wheels. But with a turning circle of 12.3 metres overall, manoeuvrability in tight urban conditions certainly isn&rsquo;t one of this car&rsquo;s biggest strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you the i8 Roadster is lacking speed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-sports-cars&quot;&gt;There are quicker cars at this price point, granted&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;But the combination of electric and petrol power in Hybrid Drive Sport mode provides the car with both brutish four-wheel drive accelerative qualities off the line and great long distance touring traits on the open road. There is excellent flexibility across a broad range&amp;nbsp;and, once you&rsquo;ve wound on sufficient revs, there\'s&amp;nbsp;a stirring engine note, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to top&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/bmw-i8-roadster-priced-%C3%82%C2%A3124735&quot;&gt;changes to the suspension bushings and a new vertical strut for improved wheel control&lt;/a&gt; at the rear, there remains some annoying tyre roar on less-than-smooth surfaces. However,&amp;nbsp;the secondary vibrations through the carbonfibre body structure, both from the road and engine, are now much better damped than with&amp;nbsp;the earlier i8 Coup&eacute;&amp;nbsp;in a move that helps improve overall refinement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further improvements have been focused at the steering. It receives new mapping, which brings greater sensitivity around the straight ahead. It&rsquo;s still quite light by sports car standards, but there&rsquo;s now added weight off-centre. Overall, it endows the i8 Roadster with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/facelifted-bmw-i8-will-get-extra-power-longer-range&quot;&gt;more responsive feel than the i8 Coup&eacute;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to place the car more confidently in corners and indulge in its excellent dynamic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does the i8 Roadster fare against traditional sports cars?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/bmw-i8-roadster-priced-%C3%82%C2%A3124735&quot;&gt;multi-faceted appeal to the i8 Roadster&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-convertibles&quot;&gt;don&rsquo;t find in any obvious open-top rival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can cover large distances with effortless progress&amp;nbsp;and great fuel economy, switching in and out of eDrive Eco mode into Hybrid Drive Sport as the conditions allow.&amp;nbsp;The driving position is excellent, with fittingly sporting qualities within an interior that is appropriately high on quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-i8-roadster-confirmed-2018&quot;&gt;It may have been a long wait&lt;/a&gt;, but the i8 Roadster does not disappoint. The changes BMW has brought to both its powertrain and chassis not only endow the car with sharper performance but also more endearing driving qualities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i8&quot;&gt;than the earlier coup&eacute;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of these changes, the fixed-roof version of the headlining i model also promises to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-sports-cars&quot;&gt;take a step up the sports car pecking order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-06-03 18:44:57'),

We have praised past 7-series generations for bridging the gap between luxury and athleticism, but unfortunately we can\'t say the same for this latest offering. It\'s basically the antithesis of a sports sedan: The ride is soft, the steering is light, and it\'s set up to cruise silently for hours, pampering its occupants with tech and comfort features along the way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a27022312/2020-bmw-7-series-drive/&quot;&gt;Powertrains range&lt;/a&gt; from the 320-hp turbocharged inline-six to the monstrous twin-turbo V-12 in the range-topping M760i; buyers seeking good fuel economy can opt for the 745e plug-in hybrid model. No matter the powertrain, the 7-series is best when it is equipped with the optional semi-autonomous driving mode so you can sit back and leave the driving to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE MODEL YEARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/amv-prod-cad-assets/images/17q3/685270/2017-bmw-740e-xdrive-plug-in-hybrid-test-review-car-and-driver-photo-689722-s-original.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.819xh;0,0.0945xh&amp;amp;resize=300:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/bmw/7-series-2019&quot;&gt;2019 BMW 7-Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\'s New for 2020?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW has given its flagship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a25904279/2020-bmw-7-series-photos-info/&quot;&gt;a thorough refresh for the 2020 model year&lt;/a&gt;, starting with exterior styling revisions that include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a28185343/bmw-7-series-grille/&quot;&gt;a much larger front grille&lt;/a&gt;, new front and rear bumpers, new exterior lighting elements, and a higher, flatter hood. A self-parking feature is now standard across the lineup, as are LED adaptive headlamps and a heated steering wheel; 740i and 745e models come standard with 20-way adjustable front seats. The 750i model now comes only with all-wheel drive and receives a more powerful twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 making 523 horsepower. The plug-in hybrid model ditches last year\'s four-cylinder/electric motor arrangement for a six-cylinder gasoline engine with electric assist for a total of 389 horsepower and is now called the 745e; it also comes with a larger 12.0-kWh battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing and Which One to Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;740i: $87,445&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;745e: $96,545&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;750i: $103,645&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alpina B7: $143,975&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;M760i: $158,695&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead-footed among us may disagree, but the base powertrain&mdash;a turbocharged inline-six&mdash;in the 740i is perfectly suitable for this car\'s relaxed nature. It still provides plenty of gumption when you need it, but otherwise it\'s quiet and smooth, so it\'s the one we\'d recommend. Plus, its lower starting price frees up your money to go toward some luxury interior features. We\'d pick the Cold Weather package, which adds heated front seats and steering wheel, heated rear seats, and a remote start feature. We\'d also splurge on the Driving Assistance Professional package&mdash;a semi-autonomous driving mode that is particularly useful in traffic jams&mdash;so we can relax and let the car do some of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engine, Transmission, and Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engines and transmissions are at the top of the short list of highlights here. Every single one, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15094735/2016-bmw-740i-long-term-test-review/&quot;&gt;the 740i\'s 320-hp turbocharged inline-six&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15096385/2017-bmw-m760i-xdrive-tested-review/&quot;&gt;the M760i\'s insane 601-hp twin-turbo V-12&lt;/a&gt;, is velvety smooth and feels more muscular than its official horsepower figures indicate. Even the 745e plug-in\'s combination of a turbocharged six-cylinder engine and an electric motor is powerful and manages to drive with a natural feel that\'s absent from most hybrids. Every 7-series shares some variation of the same slick-shifting eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive (known as xDrive in BMW marketing speak) is optional on the 740i and standard on the rest of the lineup. No matter which of the car\'s drive modes you select, the suspension is pillowy soft and body control is in short supply. The 7-series has adequate cornering grip, but the suspension\'s moves in general&mdash;and the numb, light steering in particular&mdash;discourage their exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g27011971/2020-bmw-7-series-drive-gallery/&quot;&gt;VIEW PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020-bmw-750i-xdrive-143-hdr-1566180107.jpg?crop=0.782xw:0.783xh;0,0.217xh&amp;amp;resize=480:*&quot; alt=&quot;2020 BMW 7-series rear&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL SIMARICAR AND DRIVER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE ON THE BMW 7-SERIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bmw-7-series-lead-1547592394.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.822xh;0,0.102xh&amp;amp;resize=300:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a25904279/2020-bmw-7-series-photos-info/&quot;&gt;The 2020 BMW 7-series Has 40 Percent More Grille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/amv-prod-cad-assets/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/G11-3.jpg?fill=2:1&amp;amp;resize=300:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g15085979/40-years-of-the-bmw-7-series/&quot;&gt;40 Years of the BMW 7-series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2020-bmw-7-series-staticjpg-1547575165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.822xh;0,0.0945xh&amp;amp;resize=300:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g25906696/2020-bmw-7-series-photos-info-gallery/&quot;&gt;Every Photo of the Redesigned 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Range, Charging, and Battery Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 745e plug-in hybrid model uses a 12.0-kWh battery pack located in the trunk and is said to provide up to 16 miles of electric-only driving. The pack can be recharged using 110-volt, 220-volt, or DC fast-charging systems, the latter two of which are the recommended ways to add juice quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not for the thirsty 12-cylinder M760i, the 7-series lineup overall would have an impressive set of EPA fuel-economy ratings. The six-cylinder 740i and 750i both returned better-than-average fuel economy on our 200-mile real-world highway fuel-economy test route at 30 and 29 mpg, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior, Comfort, and Cargo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, BMW\'s interior aesthetic has been serious and businesslike. That was acceptable when its cars were more about the serious business of driving. Lacking that ethos, the latest 7-series affords occupants the bandwidth to notice build quality, materials, and design that are merely average for this rich class. Sure, it\'s spacious, but so is every limousine in this class. Sure, it\'s luxurious, but one turn in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/mercedes-benz/s-class&quot;&gt;a Mercedes-Benz S-Class&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/genesis/g90&quot;&gt;the Genesis G90&lt;/a&gt;, and you\'ll be left wanting more from a car that starts at more than $80,000. Volumetrically speaking, the BMW\'s trunk has competitors such as the CT6 and G90 licked. Its 18-cubic-foot trunk is at least two cubic feet larger than the trunks of those sedans, but the reality of packing it with real-world-size carry-on bags reveals a different outcome. We could only fit three of our carry-on suitcases inside the trunk of our 740i test vehicle whereas the others held twice as many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infotainment and Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW\'s iDrive infotainment system has long since moved beyond its early teething problems to become a straightforward, attractive interface. The latest version, dubbed iDrive 7.0, can be manipulated via touchscreen or a quick and intuitive control on the center console. Every 7-series offers two USB ports for front-seat passengers and four 12-volt plugs scattered throughout. Bluetooth is standard, and a Samsung tablet with a dock between the rear seats is optional, giving passengers remote access to some infotainment features. Apple CarPlay is standard; curiously, Android Auto isn\'t available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety and Driver-Assistance Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today\'s latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g27612164/car-safety-features/&quot;&gt;driver-assistance features&lt;/a&gt; are available or standard on every 7-series, from blind-spot monitoring to semi-autonomous self-steering highway cruise control. No 7-series, however, has been crash-tested by the two major safety outfits here in the U.S.; as a result, we cannot comment on its crashworthiness. Key safety features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standard low-speed automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Available lane-keeping assist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Available adaptive cruise control with semi-autonomous driving mode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warranty and Maintenance Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMW\'s three-year or 36,000-mile complimentary scheduled maintenance plan&mdash;which is included on every 7-series&mdash;helps distinguish its otherwise class-average four-year or 50,000-mile limited-warranty coverage. Jaguar offers five years or 60,000 miles of complimentary maintenance with the purchase of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/jaguar/xj&quot;&gt;a new XJ&lt;/a&gt; sedan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caranddriver.com/lincoln/continental&quot;&gt;Black Label models of Lincoln\'s Continental&lt;/a&gt; come with four years or 50,000 miles of service.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-06-03 18:46:57');
